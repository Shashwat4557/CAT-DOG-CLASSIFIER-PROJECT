# CAT-DOG-CLASSIFIER-PROJECT

## Cat-Dog Classification using Keras and Neural Network
This is a common computer vision project to classifier images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use ****Convolution Neural Network**** (CNN) for classification using ****Keras****. **Data Augmentaion** is also used in this.

## Dataset
The data can be downloaded in the kaggle website using this link **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset/data** . Please make sure to extract this and save it in a folder called Data.
